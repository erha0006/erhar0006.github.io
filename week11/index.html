                <p>
                 To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. But the transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in advanced economies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability. 

                 Every one of us can help limit global warming and taje care of our planet. By changing out habits and making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we have the power to confront the climate challege and build a more sustainable world.
