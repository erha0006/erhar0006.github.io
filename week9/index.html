                <p>
                 To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. But the transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in advanced economies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability.
